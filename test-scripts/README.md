# Just Some Scripts

These are some scripts to stress test teh GPU with meaningless tensors. Can be used with Cuda. MPS. or CPU computing engines.  This will let you see if your GPU is actually being used, and I'm sure of someone would liek they could use them to determine the capacity of their GPU.

Enjoy.
