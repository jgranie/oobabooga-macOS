# Open Letter To Apple Development Team

## Planning to send soon.

Hey, I know this is an old thread, but it illuminates the issue here very well.

The issue is not presently a technical issue, it is a people issue. The Apple team tells us to go to the SciPy, PyTorch, NumPy developers, and those developers have stated that here are problems with Apple they cannot control, so any problems take it up with the Apple team. Now I don't mean to complain, but I do take issue with all this as it is classic finger pointing. I'm not going to say whether it's Apple's or the Python package developers' fault. It really doesn't matter who talks or doesn't talk to whom. There is NO talking, communication, or guidance from either side. Data Analytics developers, you need to reach a hand out to Apple and Apple, you need to reach out to the Data Analytics community. These are valuable, loyal Apple customers who, paid a lot of money for their hardware, and wish to use YOUR computing platform to do their work and you are totally ignoring them. They get brushed off, which is not supportive of your Apple user community which is bad for everyone. It even affects Apple negatively by generating ill-will in the user community, lose marketshare to Nvidia. While these loyal Apple Customers prefer to use a MacBook Pro M2 Max with 96GB RAM to do their work. They paid a premium for Apple hardware which  increased your revenue numbness. As a bonus, if they enjoy using their machines for doing their work these people will be happy and the good will you generate in the community will, in turn, generate, more sales. Many loyal Apple customers may view their decision with regret, and that is potentially one, if not more lost sales as they purchase platforms which actually have support for their work. That erodes the community, stifles growth, innovation and collaboration. because they have hardware which is very capable, almost non-existent support from Apple.

Comments like the one above, I presume is from one of the development team, does little to foster the welfare of the community and is, quite frankly dismissive.

> You will have to ask the scipy(sic) developers about their code. I'm aware of community practices with regards to(sic) tools like conda. I don't think those practices work well in [the](https://www.example.com/) Mac world. Quite frankly, I don't think they work well in the Linux world either. I've seen people go through an awful lot of trouble, and spend an awful lot of money, when they just didn't realize they were running buggy, out-of-date versions of libraries.

Not only is it dismissive, it is ill informed, and condescending. With statements like "I don't think those practices work well in the Mac World, I don't think they work well in the Linux world either." This is conjecture, and the next statement is anecdotal in nature, and sure there are bugs in the package manager, all of them have them, but working together is how we eliminate the bugs. If you want to point fingers regarding software and package distribution, how many times has Apple put out and update of or for macOS where they went, "through an awful lot of trouble, and spend an awful lot of money, when they just didn't realize they were running buggy, [up-to-date] versions of [software]." He then goes on to state that the WWDC will have new versions of Accelerate, "along with everything else." Whatever everything else is, I could probably guarantee from  [nk_kennedy](https://developer.apple.com/forums/profile/nk_kennedy)'s other posts, that "everything" is only within the Apple ecosystem. I've read some of his other posts and is less than helpful when someone asks a reasonable question about hosting a Swift web application to serve his application, again, no amassers, but,

> There is no "typical" backend. Firebase only seems popular because so many people have problems with it and post about it. ðŸ˜„ I strongly encourage looking at AWS. They have many, many solutions available. Many of them are low-cost or even free initially.

The glib response does not solve the user's problem and only reinforces the notion the Apple Dev Team really don't care about things outside the Apple ecosystem and assisting the community, including the Open Source Community. But in typical form, is ridiculing the community, but I don't mean to pick on him exclusively, it is everywhere.

About 15 years ago, the I was working with Sun Microsystems, they realized ,too late, the value of embracing Open Source and its community.  I was part of the OpenSolaris Community which still thrives some 15 years after Oracle consumed Sun. This community was important to sun and they tried to grow and foster the community, which they did very successfully.

I realize Apple had AI and ML tools coming out very soon, but they will require everyone to use Swift, in their AI kingdom, however the AI community has adopted Python as its  ___lingua franca___ for AI. Additionally, the AI community has fully embraced by all. This was started boy OpenAI to ensure AI technology was open and accessible to all. Today Hugging Face is the core repository for almost anything related to AI. I would imagine Apple probably even used some of the items from the Hugging Face Vault internally. Do I expect Apple to give back to the Open Source Community? Not really, though it might take a lesson from Sun Microsystems who waited too long and Linux by that time was a viable replacement fro Solaris.''

But while on the subject of Unix, isn't Apple macOS still a POSIX complaint Unix operating system under the shiny UI? Apple has thee Mach kernel, developed at Carnegie Melon, and open sourced. What about the command line utilities, shell and even some of the language technology, well that's either GNU tools, including language and compiler tools with some of the old vestiges of NeXTStep lurking under the covers, NS_INT, NS_STRING anyone want to guess what the "NS" is? So Apple owes a whole lot to the Open Source community and probably does give back, but only what they need and don't make a big deal of it, as it's not as flashy as the UI and iCloud.

I mentioned Sun a minute ago and they were destroyed by Open Source and the commercialization of Linux. Now look at Hugging Face, they are the keepers of all things AI in the Open Source world. Just the other day, maybe yesterday, they signed and agreement with Nvidia to build enormous GPU farms which may be bought by the hour and size of the GPU cluster you desire. This is a missile aimed directly at OpenAI. Microsoft, Meta, and Google, and to some extent Apple as well.

Apple, last time I checked, was a full functioning Unix Operating system with all the things that go with it. I know that some internal code in the macOS isn written in Perl, Ruby, Python, and more. SQLite is an open source light weight database handling most anything which needs a backing database macOS.
